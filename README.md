# Data_cleaning_formatting_Python_script
These folders consist of Jupyter Notebook file with python codes I used to format the excel data.
One file with spliting description was used to split data of excel cell in to multiple rows with splited string seperated by "/".
Re-indexed and saved in excel sheet again using Pandas.

Second folder has the Jupyter notebook codes to replace space with "_" in the column header and split date time into two comluns.
then the excel data is imported to MySql database.
